## How did this, become this, become that?

Did you know that if you repeatedly rotate an image in Photoshop, it eventually breaks down and may produce something similar to a differential growth alogrithm?

## How to

This only works in Photoshop (though I‚Äôll add any other language / app variations I can verify).

It‚Äôs generally good to have a canvas that‚Äôs bigger than the image you want to alter, but you can always change that later too. You‚Äôll also probably want to save the file as `Large Document Format` (.psb) before you begin as the file size gets real big, real fast.

- Select a layer to apply the script to.
- Go to `File` menu, choose `Scripts`, then `Browse‚Ä¶` and select the file you downloaded from here
- You will be prompted to input the settings you would like to use:
    - Number of degrees of rotation `-360 ‚Äî 360`. Integer or decimal
    - Number of revolutions `2 ‚Äì 300+ (be sane tho)`. Integers only
    - Interpolation method. One of the four text choices
- Sit back and wait üç∏

## Examples of settings:

### Interpolation (60 revolutions):

**bicubic**

**bicubicSharper**
![bicubicSharper 60 revolutions](zzz--example_images/bicubicsharper.png)
the best IMHO

**bicubicSmoother**
![bicubicSmoother 60 revolutions](zzz--example_images/bicubicsmoother.png)

**nearestNeighbor**
![nearestNeighbor 60 revolutions](zzz--example_images/nearestneighbor.png)

### Degrees:

###Possible Titles:

- Rotating into Oblivion, Rotating Images into Oblivion
- Growtations, Growthations, Grothations
