# Rotational Growth Photoshop Scripts

## How to

It‚Äôs generally good to have a canvas bigger than the image you want to alter. You‚Äôll also probably want to save the file as `Large Document Format` (.psb) ass the file size gets real big, real fast.

- Select a layer to apply the script to.
- Go to `File` menu, choose `Scripts`, then `Browse‚Ä¶` and select the file you want to use
- Sit back and wait üç∏

### Possible to dos:

- recenter every revolution (nearest neighbor)
- error check the prompts for float & int?
- add layers for the first 2 revolutions
- clip rotation at 360 (so if degrees = 133, then do 133, 133, 94)
- add random actions / strokes / filters at times to alter the animation

- add prompts for degrees, repeats, and interpolation
